# frequent-algorithm [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/frequent-algorithm.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/frequent-algorithm) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/buruzaemon/frequent-algorithm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/buruzaemon/frequent-algorithm) 

Web site usage, social network behavior and Internet traffic are examples
of systems that appear to follow the [Power law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law),
where most of the events are due to the actions of a very small few.
Knowing at any given point in time which items are trending is valuable
in understanding the system.

`frequent-algorithm` is a Ruby implementation of the FREQUENT algorithm
for identifying frequent items in a data stream in sliding windows.
Please refer to [Identifying Frequent Items in Sliding Windows over On-Line
Packet Streams](http://erikdemaine.org/papers/SlidingWindow_IMC2003/), by
Golab, DeHaan, Demaine, L&#243;pez-Ortiz and Munro (2003).

## Introduction

### Challenges

Challenges for Real-time processing of data streams for _frequent item queries_
include:

* data may be of unknown and possibly unbound length
* data may be arriving a very fast rate
* it might not be possible to go back and re-read the data
* too large a window of observation may include stale data

Therefore, a solution should have the following characteristics:

* uses limited memory
* can process events in the stream in &#927;(1) constant time
* requires only a single-pass over the data

## Usage

    require 'frequent-algorithm'

    # data is pi to 1000 digits
    pi = File.read('test/frequent/test_data_pi').strip
    data = pi.scan(/./).each_slice(b)
    
    N = 100  # size of main window
    b =  20  # size of basic window
    k =   3  # we are interested in top-3 numerals in pi
  
    alg = Frequent::Algorithm.new(N, b, k) 

    # read in and process the 1st basic window
    alg.process(data.next)

    # and the top-3 numerals are?
    top3 = alg.statistics.report
    puts top3

    # lather, rinse and repeat
    alg.process(data.next)
