   $ rake test
4. Build and confirm successful installation of gem
   $ rake build install

Updated API documentation for the new gem version will appear

*. If you need to pull back a released gem
   $ gem yank GEM -v VERSION [-p PLATFORM] [--undo] [--key KEY_NAME]

     re-release the same version. You will have to increment
     the release version number, and release this new version.
